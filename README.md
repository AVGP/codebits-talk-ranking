# Codebits talk proposal ranking

I love the Codebits conferences and I usually submit some talks...
but it's ridiculously tricky to figure how your proposals are actually ranking,
because when you're logged in the list is not ordered by ratings 
and you only get an overview of all votes per talk.

So to figure out the number of positive votes, you'd have to click on each proposal 
and scroll down to the voting buttons to get the number of positive votes.

Yeah, I got other things to do, so I automated this :D

# Run it

    $ bundle
    $ ruby main.rb
    
Have a lot of fun and see you at Codebits, maybe!
